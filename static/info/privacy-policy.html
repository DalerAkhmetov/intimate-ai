            <p>The Services allow you to input information that may be sensitive and subject to special protections under applicable laws. This section explains how we use and protect sensitive information.</p>
            <p>● Sensitive information you provide in your messages and content. In your conversations with your AI companion, you may choose to provide information about your religious views, sexual orientation, political views, health, racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership. By providing sensitive information, you consent to our use of it for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Note, however, that we will not use your sensitive information &ndash; or any content of your Intimate conversations &ndash; for marketing or advertising.</p>
            <h2><a></a>3. How we share your information</h2>
            <h3><a></a>A. Service providers</h3>
            <p>We share your information with companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Services or our business (such as hosting, information technology, customer support, email delivery, and website analytics services). We also share information with companies that provide marketing services on our behalf, but we do not share the content of your Intimate conversations for marketing or advertising purposes. For example, we may share your email address with marketing service providers to deliver our marketing emails to you on our behalf and to help us identify other individuals who may be interested in our Services. We require these marketing service providers to agree not to use your email address for any other purpose.</p>
            <h3><a></a>B. Professional advisors</h3>
            <p>We may share information with professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, bankers, and insurers, where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.</p>
            <h3><a></a>C. Advertising partners</h3>
            <p>We share information about visitors to our Website, such as the links you click, pages you visit, IP address, advertising ID, and browser type with advertising companies for interest-based advertising and other marketing purposes. Sharing this information allows us and our advertising partners to target and serve advertising to you and others. We will never share your Intimate conversations or any photos or other content you provide within the Apps with our advertising partners, or use such information for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
            <h3><a></a>D. Authorities and others</h3>
            <p>We may share information with law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties, as we believe in good faith to be necessary or appropriate for the legal compliance and protection purposes described above in Section 2.A.</p>
            <h3><a></a>E. Business transferees</h3>
            <p>We may share information with acquirers and other relevant participants in business transactions (or negotiations for such transactions) involving a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, sale, or other disposition of all or any portion of the business or assets of, or equity interests in, Astarto Group LTD. (including, in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</p>
            <h2><a></a>4. How we secure your information</h2>
            <p>We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>
            <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
            <p>All transmitted data are encrypted during transmission. We use standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption that encodes information for such transmissions. All stored data are maintained on secure servers. Access to stored data is protected by multi-layered security controls, including firewalls, role-based access controls, and passwords.</p>
            <p>While we use reasonable commercial efforts to protect the data, no technology, data transmission, or system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. In the event of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to your data, we will notify you as soon as we spot the issue.</p>
            <h2><a></a>5. Where we store your information</h2>
            <p>The information you provide to us may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the U.S.A., a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen.</p>
            <h2><a></a>6. Data retention</h2>
            <p>We will retain your personal information for only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
            <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
            <h2><a></a>7. Your rights and choices</h2>
            <h3><a></a>A. Opt-out of marketing communications</h3>
            <p>You may opt out of marketing-related emails and other communications by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions in the communications you receive from us or by contacting us as provided in the &ldquo;Contact us&rdquo; section below. You may continue to receive Services-related and other non-marketing emails from us.</p>
            <h3><a></a>B. Opt out of selling personal information and sharing for targeted advertising</h3>

Our disclosure of information to these partners may be considered a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; or &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; of personal information or &ldquo;targeted advertising&rdquo; under applicable laws. You can opt out of these disclosures and limit our use of tracking technologies as described in our Cookie Policy or by clicking the &ldquo;Your Privacy Choices&rdquo; link in our Website footer. In addition, some internet browsers can be configured to send &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; or similar signals.</p>
            <h3><a></a>C. Limit our use of sensitive personal information</h3>
            <p>If you choose to provide sensitive personal information in your messages and content, we will use that information only to facilitate your conversation with your AI companion and as described in the &ldquo;Sensitive information&rdquo; section above. If you do not want us to process your sensitive information for these purposes, please do not provide it. You may request that we delete information you have provided as set out in the &ldquo;Personal information requests&rdquo; section below.</p>
            <h3><a></a>D. Personal information requests</h3>
            <p>We also offer you choices that affect how we handle the personal information that we control. Depending on your location and the nature of your interactions with our Services, you may request the following in relation to personal information:</p>
            <p>● Information about how we have collected and used personal information. We have made this information available to you without having to request it by including it in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>● Withdrawal of consent, where we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
            <p>● Additional rights, such as to object to and request that we restrict our use of personal information.</p>
            <p>To make a request, please contact us as provided in the &ldquo;Contact us&rdquo; section below. We may ask for specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. Depending on where you reside, you may be entitled to empower an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. We will require authorized agents to confirm their identity and authority, in accordance with applicable laws. You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination.</p>
            <p>In some instances, your choices may be limited, such as where fulfilling your request would impair the rights of others, our ability to provide a service you have requested, or our ability to comply with our legal obligations and enforce our legal rights. If you are not satisfied with how we address your request, you may submit a complaint by contacting us as provided in the &ldquo;Contact us&rdquo; section below. Depending on where you reside, such as if you reside in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, you may have the right to complain to a data protection regulator where you live or work, or where you feel a violation has occurred.</p>
